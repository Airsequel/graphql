## AST
- Simplify unnecessary `newtypes` with type synonyms
- Simplify wrapper type constructors. Some types can be just constructors.
- Data type accessors
- Deal with strictness/unboxing
- Deal with location

## Parser
- Secure Names
- Optimize `name` and `whiteSpace`: `take...`, `T.fold`, ...
- Handle escape characters in string literals
- Guard for `on` in `FragmentSpread`
- Handle `[Const]` grammar parameter. Need examples
- Handle `maxBound` Int values.
- Diagnostics. Perhaps port to `parsers` and use `trifecta` for diagnostics,
  and `attoparsec` for performance.
- Improve comment handling: perhaps front the main parser with a lexer.

## Tests

- Pretty print golden result
