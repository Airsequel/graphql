GraphQL implementation in Haskell.

This implementation is relatively low-level by design, it doesn't provide any
mappings between the GraphQL types and Haskell's type system and avoids
compile-time magic. It focuses on flexibility instead instead, so other
solutions can be built on top of it.

## State of the work

For now this only provides a parser and a printer for the GraphQL query
language and allows to execute queries and mutations without the schema
validation step. But the idea is to be a Haskell port of
[`graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js).

For the list of currently missing features see issues marked as
"[not implemented](https://github.com/caraus-ecms/graphql/labels/not%20implemented)".
