# Haskell GraphQL

[![Hackage Version](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/graphql.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/graphql)

For now this only provides the data types to represent the GraphQL AST,
but the idea is to be a Haskell port of
[`graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js). Next releases
should include:

- [x] GraphQL AST
- [ ] Parser for the GraphQL language.
- [ ] GraphQL Schema AST.
- [ ] Parser for the GraphQL Schema language.
- [ ] Interpreter of GraphQL requests.
- [ ] Utilities to define GraphQL types and schema.

See the TODO file for more concrete tasks.
